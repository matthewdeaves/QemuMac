# Build, test, profile and bench the Radeon emulator

Commands for building `qemu-install/` from `qemu-source/`, running offline R300 tests, running a
dev build against the VM, profiling with `sample`, and benching each Quake port.
One section, copy-paste blocks; read the whole file (it is short).

## Commands

```bash
# Build (macOS): install-deps.sh option 3 builds radeon-9700 tip into
# qemu-install/ from qemu-source/.
./install-deps.sh

# Fast incremental build during dev, in the fork's checkout (~/Documents/qemu):
cd ~/Documents/qemu/build && PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" ninja qemu-system-ppc   # Apple tools first: a Retro68 Rez elsewhere breaks the build

# Offline 3D tests (macOS, needs Metal), in the fork's checkout:
sh ~/Documents/qemu/tests/r300/run.sh

# Run a dev build against the VM (QEMUMAC_QEMU_INSTALL_DIR points at a dir
# with bin/qemu-system-ppc, bin/qemu-img symlinked to the qemu build dir):
QEMUMAC_QEMU_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/dev-install ./run-mac.sh --config vms/power_mac_g4_tiger_3d/power_mac_g4_tiger_3d.conf
# (qemu-vm.sh up passes the same variable through)

# CI:
tests/ci/macos-radeon-build.sh

# Profile (macOS `sample` of QEMU during a game; guest-CPU-thread top
# functions and Radeon share):
old-mac-quakespasm/scripts/qemu-profile.sh <quakespasm|quake2|ioquake3-bench> [seconds] [out]

# Bench (each Quake port):
<port>/scripts/bench.sh qemu-tiger3d <demo> 1024x768 1   # Q1/Q2: demo1, Q3: four
```

Debug switches cost fps and must be off for any bench: `R300_DRAWLOG`,
`PPCGPU_DIAG`, `PPCGPU_RATE`, `R300_DUMP`.
